DSN normalization is critical ensuring an even distribution of coverage across probes.  There are a genes that are highly expressed in all cells and DSN normalization helps to remove these high abundance probes and transcripts.  

#### DSN needs to be properly dilued and should be tested for activity levels before proceeding

#### The protocol below was taken from Illumina's recommendations [LINK](https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/myillumina/7836bd3e-3358-4834-b2f7-80f80acb4e3f/dsn_normalization_sampleprep_application_note_15014673_c.pdf)

#### Equipment
- Thermocycler
- Magentic stand compatible with strip tubes

#### Procedure

- First pool individual RNA libraries in equal quantities to create a single pool of 500 ng.
	- For example pool 125 ng each of four individual libraries.

- Create a 4X hybridization solution

|Component|Volume|
|---------|------|
|1 M HEPES buffer solution| 200 𝜇l|
|5 M NaCl solution| 400 𝜇l|
|Nuclease‐free water| 400 𝜇L|
|--Total Volume--|--1000 𝜇--L|

- Use two thermocyclers and set one to hold at 68°C
- Prepare the following reaction mix in a separate, sterile, nuclease‐free 200 ul PCR tube on ice for each sample to be normalized.

|Component|Volume|
|---------|------|
|Sample library (500 ng)| 13.5 𝜇l|
|4X Hybridization buffer| 4.5 𝜇l|
|--Total Volume Per Sample--|--18 𝜇--L|

- Gently pipette the entire volume up and down 10 times, then centrifuge briefly to mix.
- Transfer the entire volume of reaction mix directly to the bottom of a new, sterile, nuclease‐free 200 ul PCR tube, using a pipette. Do not let the sample contact the side of the tube during the process.
- Incubate the reaction mix tube on the thermal cycler using the following PCR cycling conditions:

|Step|Temp|Duration|
|----|----|--------|
|Initial denaturation|98 °C|2 min|
|Treatment|68 °C|5 hours|

- --Caution--- Following incubation, keep the thermal cycler lid closed and the temperature held at 68°C. Do not remove the reaction mix tube from thermal cycler prior to and during DSN treatment.
- Dilute the 10X DSN Master buffer supplied in the DSN kit to 2X with nuclease‐ free water
- Pre‐heat the 2X DSN buffer on the pre‐heated heat block at 68°C.
  - --Note:-- Do not remove the 2X DSN buffer from the heat block during DSN treatment.
- Quickly add 20 ul of pre‐heated 2X DSN buffer to the first reaction mix tube.
- With the reaction mix tube remaining within the thermal cycler, gently pipette the entire volume up and down 10 times to mix thoroughly using a pipette set to 40 ul.
  - --Note--:Pipette the solution directly to the bottom of the PCR tube and do not let the sample contact the side of the tube during the process.
  - --Note--: It is important to keep the thermal cycler closed, except for the time necessary to add the 2X DSN buffer and mix. When preparing more than one reaction mix tube, keep the thermal cycler lid closed when extracting the 2X DSN buffer from its tube, then open the thermal cycler lid only for the time necessary to add and mix the 2X DSN buffer.
- Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each reaction mix tube.
- Incubate the reaction mix tubes on the thermal cycler at 68°C for 10 minutes.
- Quickly add 2 ul of DSN enzyme to the first reaction mix tube using a 2 ul pipette.
- With the reaction mix tube remaining within the thermal cycler, gently pipette the entire volume up and down 10 times to mix thoroughly using a pipette set to 40 ul.
  - --Note--:Pipette the solution directly to the bottom of the PCR tube and do not let the sample contact the side of the tube during the process.
- Repeat steps 6 and 7 for each reaction mix tube.
- Incubate the reaction mix tubes on the thermal cycler at 68°C for 25 minutes.
- Add 40 ul of 2X DSN stop solution to each reaction mix tube. Gently pipette the entire volume up and down to mix thoroughly, then place the tubes on ice.
