To rehydrate oligos:
Resuspend Oligos
IDT says to multiply # of nmoles on vial by 10 and add the answer µL of buffer to bring concentration to 100µM.  We want 200µM so we are multiplying by 5.

```{r}
# P2.1 from 2016-04-26 has 51.4nmoles
(x <- 51.4 * 5)
```
Add `r x`uL of 1xTE buffer to the IDT tube.

```{r}
# P2.2 from 2016-04-26 has 78.6nmoles
(x <- 78.6 * 5)
```

Go to the google doc "Oligo Construction and Resuspension” in the Pinsky Lab folder
Click on the “Resuspension” Tab
Scroll to the bottom, enter the date of resuspension, name of adapter on tube, nm of adapter on tube, and drag down the “amount of TE…” and “Final mol” cells
