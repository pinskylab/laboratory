Pooled into [baits 10](../baits10_2018-09-11)

PCR index 3 

2018-08-29 Wednesday - Cleaned, while cleaning P119, at the final elution noticed that I had put 30uL in twice, so there were 60uL instead of 30.  Re-cleaned that pool in order to get it down to 30uL.  While re-cleaning, I over dried the pellet and it looks like some mightâ€™ve been sucked into the vacuum of the vacufuge.  Still had a nice brown color when resuspended but if that pool seems low in reads or quantification, that would be why.

In P119 a lot of the digest volumes in the plate D4492-D4587 are fairly low after robot transfer
