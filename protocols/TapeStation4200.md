#TapeStation 4200


Last updated by Ryan Snow on 2/1/23. The following protcol was designed and adapted from the Agilent D1000 Protocol. Please refer to the manufacturer's kit guide for additional protocol information.

This protocol is intended for Genomic DNA.


##Running the TapeStation

1. Remove samples and reagents from storage
	* Allow sample to acclimate to RT for 30 minutes

2. Record sample and reagent record log form(s) attached
	* Ladder (Φ) will always be in position A1
	* Store in lab notebook

3. Launch TapeStation Controller software

4. Record sample and reagent information in TapeStation Controller software
	* Ladder (Φ) will always be in position A1

5. Flick ScreenTape(s) to remove any bubbles if necessary

6. Load TapeStation deck with consumables
	* ScreenTape(s)
		* First ScreenTape will be placed into the ScreenTape nest
		* Additional ScreenTape(s) will be placed in the ScreenTape rack leaving room for the first ScreenTape
	* Tips

7. Vortex and spin samples

8. Label tube strip(s) and/or 96-well plates
	* Ensure good documentation practices to track sample position

9. Prepare TapeStation Ladder in position A1 
(3 uL Genomic Sample Buffer:1 uL Genomic Ladder)
	* For 1 ScreenTapes; load 3 uL of Genomic Sample Buffer and 1 uL Genomic Ladder
	* For 2 ScreenTapes; load 6 uL of Genomic Sample Buffer and 2 uL Genomic Ladder
	* For 3+ ScreenTapes; load 15 uL of Genomic Sample Buffer and 5 uL Genomic Ladder

10. Per sample, load 3 uL Genomic Sample Buffer and 1 uL of DNA sample in planned position(s)
	* Apply lid to sample tube strip and/or plate after adding sample

11. Vortex at 2000 rpm for 1 minute using the IKAMS3 vortexer
	* Located near the TapeStation

12. Spin down for 1 minute to remove sample and ladder from lid

13. Load TapeStation instrument
	* Ladder must be in position A1

14. Remove sample lid before closing and running instrument
	* Verify sample presence
	* Close TapeStation lid

15. On the TapeStation computer click Start
	* Confirm information in pop-up dialogue box
	* Move on to Data Analysis after run is complete

##Data Analysis

1. Follow instructions in Run Finished dialogue box
	* Label and store any partially used ScreenTapes as such
	* Discard used tips
		* Best practice to replace tips after use
	* Remove samples from TapeStation
	* Store ScreenTape(s) in Used ScreenTapes container

2. Save and export data using the following naming convention:
[Initials/Personal Identifier][Relevant Run Info]-[MMDDYY]

Ex. for Ryan Snow Test Run on Jan 18th, 2023
SnTR-011823

3. Data should default to saving in the following location:
	Documents > Agilent > [Run Date] > [File Name]
