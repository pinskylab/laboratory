## Prepare a stock solution of Tris-HCl  
- usually don't need more than 50mL of solution, it is ok to prepare this in a small, clean, beaker, and transfer to a 50mL falcon tube.  
- when calculating % weight to volume, it is always grams to mL.
```{r edta, echo=FALSE}

sds <- tribble(~item, ~quantity,
                      "sds_g", (params$final_conc_perc/100) * params$final_vol_ml,
                    "ph2o_ml", params$final_vol_ml)

kable(sds)

```
