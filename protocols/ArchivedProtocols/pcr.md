This protocol assumes that you have read and understand the manufacturer’s instructions attached below.  Please read the full manufacturer’s instructions before using this abbreviated protocol.

PCR pools

- update sample_data file with PCR numbers and indices
- open [PCR worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGt2WziwmGoJMluBcwmKfhZrGjZOlJLkVHf59-5cOV4/edit?usp=sharing) and calculate master mix: 
- Run each pool in 4 rxns at 10µL of sample each in 20µL reactions
- Don’t include R primer in master mix, add later…example recipe looks like:
- Place 9µL master mix in each well
- Place 10µL sample in each well
- Place 1µL R primer (of the correct index) in each well
- Run on thermocycler PHUSION_PCR which is 98˚ for 30 sec, (98˚ for 10 sec, 64˚ for 30 sec, 72˚  for 30 sec) X 12, 72˚ for 10 minutes, hold at 4˚C
- After the thermocycler finishes (~35 minutes) Combine the reactions of each pool individually in tubes (o-ring if not cleaning immediately) labeled on the top with the pool number and on the side with

“PCR #"
not clean
date

Clean the PCR products separately (separate pools)
each pool should be 80µL
add 120µL Ampure - elute into 40µL TE

Qubit the pools
Make a note of the supplies used and update the inventory

For PCR Single reaction volumes:
7.9 pH2O
4.0 Phusion buffer
0.5 MgCl2
0.4 10mM dNTPs
1.0 F Primer
1.0 R Primer (2_2)
0.2 Phusion polymerase
