## Prepare a stock solution of Tris-HCl  
- usually don't need more than 50mL of solution, it is ok to prepare this in a small, clean, beaker, and transfer to a 50mL falcon tube.  
- the molecular weight of Tris-HCl is 121.1g
```{r tris, echo=FALSE}

tris_hcl <- tribble(~item, ~quantity,
                      "tris-hcl_g", params$final_vol_l * params$mol_wt * params$final_conc_M,
                    "ph2o_ml", params$final_vol_l*1000)

kable(tris_hcl)

```
## Adjust pH to `r params$pH` using HCl or NaOH.
