## Prepare a stock solution 
- usually don't need more than 50mL of solution, it is ok to prepare this in a small, clean, beaker, and transfer to a 50mL falcon tube.  
```{r echo=FALSE}

nacl <- tribble(~item, ~quantity,
                      "nacl_g", params$final_vol_l * params$mol_wt * params$final_conc_M,
                    "ph2o_ml", params$final_vol_l*1000)

kable(nacl)

```
