## Prepare a stock solution of TE buffer
- Normally, the pico kit sends a 25mL bottle of 20x TE that can be dumped into a 500 mL flask and filled to the 500 line with distilled water from the special tap.
```{r edta, echo=FALSE}

te <- tribble(~item, ~quantity,
                      "1x_te_buffer_ul", (params$final_vol_ml*params$final_conc)/params$initial_conc)
```

TE can also be made in the lab with Tris-HCl and EDTA.
