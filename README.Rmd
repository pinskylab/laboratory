## This repository holds the methods we use for sequencing library preparation. 

#### Suggested Use
Our protocols change over time.  If you want to create a snapshot of your method at the time you ran the protocol, create a release.  This will create an archive of the method that you can refer back to years later when you want to share a tip with someone or reference your work in a manuscript.
