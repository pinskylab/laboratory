# Qubit Fluorometer Protocol


Last updated by Ryan Snow on 2/1/23. The following protcol was designed and adapted from the Qubit Fluorometer Protocol. Please refer to the manufacturer's kit guide for additional protocol information.

This protocol is intended for Genomic DNA.


## Running the Qubit
Refer to the relevant kit QuickGuide for additional help and information

1. Ensure all reagents are RT
	* Allow to acclimate for 30 minutes, if not already RT

2. Gather and label Qubit Fluorometer-specific assay tubes needed

3. Pipette 1*n uL of Qubit Reagent into a working stock solution (falcon) tube
	* n is the number of standards to be used plus the number of samples
	* The kit usually requires two standards (min and max range)

4. Pipette 199*n uL of Qubit Buffer into the working stock solution tube
	* n is the number of standards to be used plus the number of samples
	* The kit usually requires two standards (min and max range)

5. Pipette working stock solution to mix

6. Pipette 190 uL of working stock solution into two assay tubes
	* In each tube, add 10 uL of one of the standards provided in the kit
	* Will result in one minimum standard working tube and one maximum standard working tube

7. Pipette between 180 uL to 199 uL of working stock solution into each sample assay tube
	* The volumes used must remain consistent across samples

8. Per sample, add sample to relevant assay tube so that the total volume is 200 uL
	* The volumes used must remain consistent across samples
	* Make note of the sample volume added

9. Vortex and spin down all assay tubes 

10. Incubate all tubes at RT for 2 minutes

11. Read the standard working tubes on the Qubit

12. Read sample assay tubes on the Qubit
	* Adjust volume of sample on the Qubit to reflect the volume of sample added to the sample assay tube (Step 8)
	* Record concentration in Qubit Sample Record Sheet and/or lab notebook
