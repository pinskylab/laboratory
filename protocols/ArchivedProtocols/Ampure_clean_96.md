This protocol assumes that you have read and understand the manufacturer’s instructions attached below.  Please read the full manufacturer’s instructions before using this abbreviated protocol.

This protocol is to clean DNA in a 96 well plate

1. Fill out the spreadsheet to determine volumes of reagents needed:

2. Bring proper amount of AMPure to room temperature  (1.5 * volume of samples * # of samples)
3. Make fresh 70% EtOH - 400 * # of samples at least
4. Add qty of Ampure to sample (1.5 * volume of sample), pipet to mix,
5. Incubate 5 min,
6. Put on magnet for 2 more min, elevate with 4 tip tray liners so the magnet will form the pellet below the 40µL line., Discard supernatant once it is clear
7. Add 200µL fresh 70% EtOH, incubate 30 sec, discard supernatant
8. Add 200µL fresh 70% EtOH, incubate 30 sec, discard supernatant by removing 200µL with big pipet and then sucking again with 100µL pipet to get any residue
9. Allow to air dry 10 min (maybe less, do not allow pellet to over-dry)
10. Add *45µL* 1x TE buffer, pipet up and down to mix
11. Incubate 5 min, place on magnet 1 min (no tip tray liners)
12. Pull 40µL of supernatant into a new labeled plate and seal with film
13. Discard plate with pellets and 70% EtOH.
