*This protocol assumes that you have read and understand the manufacturer’s instructions attached below.  Please read the full manufacturer’s instructions before using this abbreviated protocol.*

This protocol is to quantify a digest plate that has been cleaned.  This is not the manufacturers method of quantification and is not recommended without testing against other methods for accuracy.  

1. For a full plate of 96 wells, make a working solution of HS buffer and dye by combining 19mL + 502uL of HS buffer with 98uL of HS dye.  (96 wells plus 2 standards)

2. Place 190 uL of working solution into an empty well and add 10uL of standard 1.
3. Place 190 uL of working solution into an empty well and add 10uL of standard 2.
4. For the rest of the wells, add 199uL of working solution with a multichannel pipet
5. Add 1uL sample to each well
5. Vortex the plate
6. Allow the plate to incubate 2 minutes.
6. Qubit the standards
7. Qubit the wells by cutting the plate apart, being very careful to keep track of the order that the wells are analyzed.
8. Export data to usb drive by hitting the data button and then the image of the usb drive.
9. Once you have verified that you have safely stored all of the data on the computer, clear the data on the qubit machine
10. In the laboratory project in RStudio, open qubit_to_db.R
11. Point to the qubit results file on the comptuer and follow the directions in the script to move the quantification to the database.
