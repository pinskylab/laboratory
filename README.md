Laboratory Work
================

**This repository holds the methods we used for sequencing library preparation ~2019.**

#### Suggested Use

Our protocols change over time. If you want to create a snapshot of your
method at the time you ran the protocol, create a release. This will
create an archive of the method that you can refer back to years later
when you want to share a tip with someone or reference your work in a
manuscript.

### [ddRADSeq](ddRADSeq)

This is used in our *Amphiprion clarkii* clownfish project and our
*Paralichthys dentatus* summer flounder project.

### [Nextera](Nextera)

This method is used in our *Myotis lucificus* little brown bat project.

### [EecSeq](EecSeq)

This is the expresded exome capture sequencing method used in *Amphiprion percula* larval trait GWAS study by Katrina Calatano ~2021.

Documenting each day's lab work and connecting sample IDs to extraction, digest, and ligation IDs for sequencing. For bioinformatcs on these samples, see the [genomics repo](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics)
