# Enter the number of libraries to be analyzed in the chip above
Contact Nichole Wagner (new39@rutgers.edu) to schedule a bioanalyzer run and get instructions from her regarding how to give her a sample of your library.

The High Sensitivity Chip can handle 12 libraries up to 7 kilobases.  If your library is larger, contact Nicole for pricing of a different chip.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
bioanalyzer <- tribble(~item, ~quantity,
                       "bioanalyzer", params$num_samples)
```
