This protocol is to clean DNA in a 96 well plate

1. Calculate the volumes of reagents needed.  The best way to do this is to use the clean tab on the [PCR worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGt2WziwmGoJMluBcwmKfhZrGjZOlJLkVHf59-5cOV4/edit?usp=sharing)

2. Bring calculated amount of AMPure to room temperature  (1.5 x volume of samples x # of samples) - takes about 5 minutes depending on temperature of lab.
3. Make a 50mL falcon tube of 70% EtOH (important that this is made fresh daily) by filling the tube to 35mL 100% EtOH and filling to the 50mL mark with distilled water.
3. Place ampure in a reagent resevoir.
4. Add 75uL of Ampure to each 50uL digestion reaction (1.5 x volume of sample) with a multichannel pipet, pipet up and down at least 3 times to mix.
5. Incubate 5 min at room temperature
6. Place 4 yellow tip tray liners on the magnet so the pellet will form below the 40µL line.
7. Put digest plate on magnet for 2 min.
7. Discard supernatant once it is clear by pipeting ~150uL out of wells.  It is ok if you don't get all of the liquid but important not to disturb the pellet.
7. Place the 50mL 70% EtOH in a new reagent reservoir.
7. Add 200µL fresh 70% EtOH, incubate 30 sec, pipet ~250uL to remove EtOH from wells.
8. Add 200µL fresh 70% EtOH, incubate 30 sec, pipet ~250uL to remove EtOH from wells.
8. Spin the plate on the plate spinner to move excess EtOH to the bottom of the wells.
8. Put the plate back on the magnet and pull with the 100uL tips and the pipet set to 75uL to remove any residue. **The pellets will be drying at this point so move quickly.**
10. Add *45µL* 1x TE buffer to each well in order to keep the pellets moist, then go back and pipet up and down to mix.
11. Incubate 5 min at room temperature on the benchtop (no magnet)
11. Remove the yellow tray tip liners from the magnet and place the plate back on magnet for 1-2 minutes (until liquid appears clear)
12. Pull 45µL of supernatant into a new labeled plate and seal with film (sometimes all 45uL does not come back, label as 40uL of sample regardless of how much fills pipet)
13. Discard plate with pellets and move the 70% EtOH into the spraybottle for cleaning the benchtop.
14. In the laboratory project in RStudio, open changedb.R and update the final_vol field for this digest plate to reflect the 40uL (or other volume if applicable) that was used to elute the DNA from the pellet.
