Plan ligation plates using the ligation.R script and generate plate maps

Fill in the sample and water according to plate maps - if you don't use a robot this takes a full day to do 2 plates ~4 hours a plate - due to evaporation concerns, load one plate and then ligate it immediately, do not store overnight prior to ligation.  
If low read numbers persist in corner wells of ligation plates, it may be necessary to ligate single pools of 48 samples as soon as they are ready.

Go to the ligate page in the PCR worksheet and double check the math (copy and paste the cells  into notebook): (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGt2WziwmGoJMluBcwmKfhZrGjZOlJLkVHf59-5cOV4/edit?usp=sharing)

Double check all reagents and make sure there is enough to start
- [ ]  P2 working adapter
- [ ] P1 working adapter
- [ ] 10x buffer
- [ ] ligase


Set up Ligation reaction 30µL reactions:

pipette P1 adapters into wells

make master mix

pipette master mix into clean empty 8 wells (154 each) and then pipette with multichannel into plates

spin plates (only hold to 15sec then let go)

allow rxn to occur on countertop at room temp for 1.5hr

place in thermocycler to heat kill (65˚ for 10 min then decrease of 2˚ every 90sec until room temp, hold at 4˚) - skip the initial 23˚ 
step

After ligation heat kill, combine all of the wells for each pool in one tube (o-ring if cleanup is not immediate) labeled with the pool # on top and on the side:

    - Pool #
    - ready to be cleaned
    - date

These pools can be stored in an o-ring tube in the refrigerator.

When ready to clean, split each pool into 4 tubes (labeled Pool#.1, Pool#.2, etc) of 360µL (lately they have been more like 300µL)  and start the first cleanup.  Combine the 4 end products of the clean up into one Pool tube and proceed to the second cleanup (volume should be 160µL).
