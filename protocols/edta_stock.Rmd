## Prepare a stock solution of Tris-HCl  
- usually don't need more than 50mL of solution, it is ok to prepare this in a small, clean, beaker, and transfer to a 50mL falcon tube.  
- the molecular weight of EDTA is 372.2g
```{r edta, echo=FALSE}

edta <- tribble(~item, ~quantity,
                      "edta_g", params$final_vol_l * params$mol_wt * params$final_conc_M,
                    "ph2o_ml", params$final_vol_l*1000)

kable(edta)

```
