## 1\. Tagment Genomic DNA

### Preparation

1.  Prepare the following
consumables:

| Item | Storage         | Instructions                                                                  |
| ---- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BLT  | 2°C to 8° C     | Bring to room temperature. Vortex to mix. Do not centrifuge before pipetting. |
| TB1  | \-25°C to ‑15°C | Bring to room temperature. Vortex to mix.                                     |

2.  Save the following TAG program on the thermal cycler:

<!-- end list -->

  - Choose the preheat lid option and set to 100°C
  - Set the reaction volume to 50 µl
  - 55°C for 15 minutes
  - Hold at 10°C

### Procedure

1.  Add 2–30 µl DNA to each well of a 96-well PCR plate so that the
    total input amount is 100–500 ng.
2.  If DNA volume \< 30 µl, add nuclease-free water to the DNA samples
    to bring the total volume to 30 µl.
3.  Vortex BLT vigorously for 10 seconds to resuspend. Repeat as
    necessary.
4.  Combine the following volumes to prepare the tagmentation master
    mix. Multiply each volume by the number of samples being processed.

<!-- end list -->

  - BLT (11 µl)
  - TB1 (11 µl)

<!-- end list -->

5.  Vortex the tagmentation master mix thoroughly to resuspend.
6.  Divide the tagmentation master mix volume equally into an 8-tube
    strip.
7.  Using a 200 µl multichannel pipette, transfer 20 μl tagmentation
    master mix to each well of the plate containing a sample. Use fresh
    tips for each sample column.
8.  Discard the 8-tube strip after the tagmentation master mix has been
    dispensed.
9.  Pipette each sample 10 times to resuspend. Use fresh tips for each
    sample column.
10. Seal the plate with Microseal ‘B’, place on the preprogrammed
    thermal cycler, and run the TAG program.

## 2\. Post Tagmentation Cleanup

### Preparation

1.  Prepare the following
consumables:

| Item | Storage          | Instructions                                                                                                                          |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TSB  | 15°C to 30°C     | If precipitates are observed, heat at 37°C for 10 minutes, and then vortex until precipitates are dissolved. Use at room temperature. |
| TWB  | room temperature | Vortex thoroughly to mix.                                                                                                             |

2.  Save the following PTC program on the thermal cycler:

<!-- end list -->

  - Choose the preheat lid option and set to 100°C
  - Set the reaction volume to 50 µl
  - 55°C for 15 minutes
  - Hold at 10°C

### Procedure

1.  Add 10 µl TSB to the tagmentation reaction.
2.  Slowly pipette each well 10 times to resuspend the beads.
3.  Seal the plate with Microseal ‘B’, place on the preprogrammed
    thermal cycler, and run the PTC program.
4.  Place the plate on the magnetic stand and wait until liquid is clear
    (~3 minutes).
5.  Using a multichannel pipette, remove and discard supernatant.
6.  Wash two times as follows:
    1.  Remove the sample plate from the magnetic stand and use a
        deliberately slow pipetting technique to add 100 µl TWB directly
        onto the beads. A deliberately slow pipetting technique
        minimizes the potential of TWB foaming to avoid incorrect volume
        aspiration and incomplete mixing.
    2.  Pipette slowly until beads are fully resuspended.
    3.  Place the plate on the magnetic stand and wait until the liquid
        is clear (~3 minutes).
    4.  Using a multichannel pipette, remove and discard supernatant.
7.  Remove the plate from the magnetic stand and use a deliberately slow
    pipetting technique to add 100 µl TWB directly onto the beads.
8.  Pipette each well slowly to resuspend the beads.
9.  Seal the plate and place on the magnetic stand until the liquid is
    clear (~3 minutes). Keep on the magnetic stand until step 4 of the
    Procedure section in Amplify Tagmented DNA.

| 100–500              | 5                        |

**SAFE STOPPING POINT**

If you are stopping, seal the plate with Microseal ‘B’ adhesive or
Microseal ‘F’ foil seal, and store at ‑25°C to ‑15°C for up to 30 days.

## 5.Pool Libraries

When the DNA input is 100-500 ng, quantifying and normalizing individual
libraries generated in the same experiment is not necessary. However,
the final yield of libraries generated in separate experiments can vary
slightly. To achieve optimal cluster density, pool equal library volumes
and quantify the pool before sequencing.

### For DNA Inputs of \< 100 ng

1.  Quantify each library individually using Qubit or PicoGreen.

#### Check Library Quality (Optional)

1.  Run 1 µl library or pooled libraries on one of the following
    instruments:

<!-- end list -->

  - Add 1 µl RSB to the library to achieve the 2 µl volume required for
    Fragment Analyzer. The following figures show typical library size
    profiles with an average fragment size of 600 bp when analyzed with
    a size range of 150–1500 bp. Dilute Libraries to the Starting
    Concentration

Table 1: Recommended Read Length on Illumina Systems

| Sequencing System | Read Length |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| NovaSeq 6000      | 2 x 151     |

*Assumes use of the 200 cycle kit.*

1.  Calculate the molarity value of the library or pooled libraries
    using the following formula.

<!-- end list -->

  - For libraries qualified on a Bioanalyzer, use the average size
    obtained for the library.
  - For all other qualification methods, use 600 bp as the average
    library size.

<!-- end list -->

2.  Using the molarity value, calculate the volumes of RSB and library
    needed to dilute libraries to the starting concentration for your
    system.

| Sequencing System | Starting Concentration (nM) | Final Loading Concentration (pM)                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| NovaSeq 6000      | 2                           | See document \# 1000000019358 (NovaSeq 6000 System Guide) |

3.  Dilute libraries using RSB:

<!-- end list -->

  - **Libraries quantified as a multiplexed library pool** —Dilute the
    pool to the starting concentration for your system.
  - **Libraries quantified individually** —Dilute each library to the
    starting concentration for your system. Add 10 µl each diluted
    library to a tube to create a multiplexed library pool.
